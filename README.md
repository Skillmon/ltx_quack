# `quack` &ndash; **QU**ick **A**nd **C**asual **K**ana

The `quack` package will eventually enable LaTeX-users to write Kana (Japanese
syllable scripts) by inputting Romaji (Latin script) and parse such a string
into Hiragana and Katakana.

The scope of this package might get wider to also cover the basic Kanji, at
which point the acronym `quack` will get a second meaning: **QU**irky **A**nd
**C**aptivating **K**anji.

If you have feature ideas/requests you'll be more than welcome to open an issue
and describe your ideas.

An early draft (which might completely change) is contained in the file
[vocabulary.tex](https://github.com/Skillmon/ltx_quack/blob/master/Examples/vocabulary.tex).
